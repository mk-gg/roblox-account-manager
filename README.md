<h1 align="center">Roblox Account Manager</h1>

A PyQt6 app for managing multiple accounts in Roblox. I created this app to simplify the tedious process of switching and logging in manually.


## Features
- Account Management
- Join games or a friend's private server
- Supports multi-instance launching (limited to short play sessions for now)

> [!TIP]
> Due to Byfron restrictions, you can currently run up to 4 Roblox instances within a 15–20 minute window. After that, Roblox will automatically reduce it to 1 active instance.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (tested on Win11 24H2 & 21H2)
- Internet Connection
- Roblox Desktop Client (not the Microsoft Store)

## Getting Started

- Download and extract the latest release from the repository.
- Launch the app and add your Roblox account.
- Fill in the required information to complete setup.
- Enter the PlaceID of the game or private server you want to join.
- Click “Launch Roblox” to start your session.


> [!CAUTION]
> Never share your account cookies. Doing so may result in your account being stolen.


## Planned Features

- Extended multi-instance support for longer play sessions
- UI improvements
- Cookie storage security
